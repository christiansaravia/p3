## Description
This is a web application built with Laravel which includes a Lorem Ipsum Generator and a Random User Generator. The tools are powered by HTML forms where the user can specify how many paragraphs and how many users they want.

The web application uses one external package to help generate the lorem ipsum text (badcow/lorem-ipsum), and a second external package to generate random user name, birthdate, and email (fzaninotto/faker).
